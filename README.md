# rusty-dropper

Rusty dropper is simple malware dropper written in rust, using Windows_sys API.
No function call obfuscation, or other evasion methods are implemented.

This code serves as POC, I do not hold any responsibility for malicious misuse.

The `shellcode.exe` included in the repo is script which runs calculator, generated by mfsvenom.

Command: `msfvenom -p windows/exec cmd=calc.exe -f c -e x86/alpha_mixed`

## Detection

Final binary is indetectable with Windows Defender, however more advanced EDR can raise allerts.

Here is comparsion between original shellcode and shellcode bundled via dropper.
For a comparsion I used [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

## Usage

1. Copy your shellcode to root directory of this project.
2. Rename it to `shellcode.exe`
3. `cargo build --release`
4. Run `target/release/rusty-sheller.exe`
5. Rename binary into something less suspicious
6. Deploy
